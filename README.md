## 🎯 What is Web CTF?

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve security-related challenges to find hidden "flags" (usually strings of text). Web CTF specifically focuses on web application security vulnerabilities and exploits.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎪 Common Web CTF Challenge Types</strong></summary>

| Challenge Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 💉 **SQL Injection** | Exploiting database queries through user input |
| 🔗 **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Injecting malicious scripts into web pages |
| 🎭 **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** | Forcing users to perform unintended actions |
| 📁 **Local/Remote File Inclusion** | Accessing unauthorized files on the server |
| 🔐 **Authentication Bypasses** | Circumventing login mechanisms |
| 💻 **Command Injection** | Executing system commands through web applications |
| 📂 **Directory Traversal** | Accessing files outside intended directories |
| 🔑 **Insecure Direct Object References** | Accessing unauthorized resources |
| 🏗️ **Server-Side Template Injection** | Exploiting template engines |
| 📦 **Deserialization Attacks** | Exploiting unsafe object deserialization |
